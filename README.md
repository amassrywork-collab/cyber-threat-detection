# 🚀 Cyber Threat Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a simple yet effective **PyTorch-based neural network** to detect potential **cybersecurity threats** from structured system log data.  
The model classifies each record as:

- **0 → Normal behavior**  
- **1 → Cyber threat**

The goal of the project is to practice deep learning fundamentals in a realistic cybersecurity setting.
